      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          👋 <strong>Hello there!</strong> I’m Kavya, an <strong>AI Engineer</strong> with a penchant for solving complex puzzles—be it predicting customer churn, optimizing resin distribution, or designing chatbots that feel like your best friend. Armed with <strong>3.5+ years of experience</strong> and an insatiable curiosity, I build intelligent systems that don’t just work—they <em>wow</em>.
        </p>
      
        <p>  
          🚀 When I’m not orchestrating neural networks to dance on GPUs, you’ll find me exploring how cutting-edge research can make everyday life a little smarter and a lot more fascinating. Whether it’s crafting <strong>GANs</strong> that create cricket highlights or developing AI tools that revolutionize manufacturing, my mission is simple: make AI work hard so humans can work smart.</p>
      
        <p>  
          💡 As an <strong>AI/ML Research Enthusiast</strong>, I geek out over <strong>generative models</strong>, <strong>NLP</strong>, and <strong>computer vision</strong>—because why stop at solving problems when you can also rewrite the rules? And as someone committed to <strong>ethical AI</strong>, I believe technology is at its best when it’s fair, transparent, and empowering for everyone.
        </p>
      
        <p>  
          ✨ <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> I once led an 8-member team to create an AI-driven gaming platform in just a week—and we walked away with the <strong>Best Project Award</strong> (and some seriously good stories).
        </p>
      
        <p>  
          Let’s connect, collaborate, and create something extraordinary—because the future isn’t just waiting to be built, it’s waiting to be <em>imagined</em>.
